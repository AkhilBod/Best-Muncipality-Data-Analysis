**Our Metrics: Sorted by Jupyter Notebook Order**
1. Property Assesments:
    - Mean Sale price of houses in the given city
    - Median Sale price of houses
    - Mean finished living area inside houses
    - Median finished living area inside houses
    - The higher the median sale prices and finished living area the better of the community is, in terms of asset wellbeing. If a certain city tends to be towards the top of the table in both categories, then it must be the best neighborhood, basedd on its rankings.
    
2. Community Surver for Income:
     - Income above $75,000
     - If a certain municipality tends to have more households, than other municpalities, that consistenly earns more than $75,000 annually, it is said to be better of regarding financial wellbeing. $75,000 which is well above the average income in the United States, is enough for an average family to live comfortably. The municipality with the most houeholds that earn "enough," is considered to be the best neighborhood, in this dataset.

3. Median Age of Death:
      - Total Median Age at Death
      - The age, at the time of death, typically indiactes the person's health lifestyle. If the median age, of a municipality, is high then that area probably has better environment to live in. The higher the median age at death, the better the physical wellbeing of its citizens are, and that is what declares a certain township to be the best.
